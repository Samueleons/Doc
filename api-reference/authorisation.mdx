## API Authorization Guide

To interact with the NLPearl.AI API, you need to authenticate your requests by including your Account ID and API secret key in the request header. This ensures that your API calls are secure and correctly attributed to your account.

### Authorization Header Format

Include the following authorization header in all your API requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer AccountId:SecretKey
```

The _**Token**_ must be in the form `AccountId:SecretKey`.

**For example**:

```http
Authorization: Bearer 66552698d60e456235eae520:tWPqr5EEZv2dxqutv58NsCg7NuqGc1tX
```

You can retrieve your Account ID and Secret Key in [our platform](https://platform.nlpearl.ai/app/settings/api).

### Example API Request

Hereâ€™s an example of how to set up the Authorization header for an API request using cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.nlpearl.ai/v1/endpoint" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer 66552698d60e456235eae520:tWPqr5EEZv2dxqutv58NsCg7NuqGc1tX"
```

Replace `66552698d60e456235eae520` and `tWPqr5EEZv2dxqutv58NsCg7NuqGc1tX` with your actual Account ID and API secret key.
