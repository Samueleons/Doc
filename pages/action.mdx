NLPearl.AI provides a range of actions that can be performed by your Pearl both during and after calls. These actions are designed to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and enhance customer interactions.


### Types of Actions

We distinguish between two types of actions that Pearl can perform:

- **In Call Actions**
- **Post Call Actions**

### In Call Actions

In call actions are tasks that Pearl can perform during the conversation. Here are some examples:

- **Book a Meeting**: Pearl can automatically schedule a meeting with the prospect and add it to your calendar.
- **Transfer a Call**: Pearl can transfer the call to another agent or department.
- **Send an SMS**: Pearl can send an SMS to the prospect during the call.
- **Send an Email**: Pearl can send an email to the prospect during the call.

### Post Call Actions

Post call actions are tasks that Pearl can perform after the conversation has ended. Here are some examples:

- **Send an SMS**: Pearl can send a follow-up SMS to the prospect after the call.
- **Send an Email**: Pearl can send a follow-up email to the prospect after the call.
- **Take a Message**: If the prospect wants to leave a message, Pearl can take the message and send it to your email.
