### Data Collection & Success Metrics

When setting up a Pearl, you have the flexibility to define various aspects of the call:

- **Collected Information**: Specify the information you want to collect from the leads during the call. This can include contact details, preferences, and other relevant data.
	See [Collected Information Variables](/pages/variables#collected-information-variables)
- **Success Metrics**:Define what constitutes a successful call for your Pearl. Success metrics can include specific actions taken by the lead, positive responses, or any other criteria relevant to your goals. This allows the system to analyze each call and determine its success rate\n\n This metric appears on the platform as _Conversation Status_.
