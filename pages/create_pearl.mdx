title: Create Your Pearl
description: 'First it is important to understand that the process of creating your phone agent is divided into two parts: the first part involves creating and customizing your Pearl for personalized conversational flows in NLPearl.AI, and the second part focuses on setting up your inbound or outbound campaign that will utilize your Pearl. Letâ€™s start by explaining and detail the first part of this process.'

### What is a Pearl?

Creating a Pearl is similar to hiring a new employee. You choose its language, character, and provide a script that explains how it should interact with customers, guiding its actions, knowledge, and responses.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Pearl

#### Step 1: Select Use Case

Choose the type of use case for your Pearl:

1. **Personal Secretary**: The secretary provides information, schedules appointments, and performs other tasks in real-time or post-call, just like a real secretary, but without making coffee. Unlike other use cases, she has no script or flow, she is a genuine secretary.
2. **Sales**: The sales agent can act in real-time or post-call with a predefined behavior focused on selling a product persistently. Give them a script, and they'll handle the rest.
3. **Support**: Similar to the salesperson, the support agent is trained to provide assistance. Their behavior is more supportive and helpful.
4. **Surveys**: Engage your audience by sharing surveys and polls via outbound or inbound to gather feedback, opinions, or votes. Enable actions like SMS, email, call transfers, and more. This Pearl model is straightforward, less flexible, and closely follows its script.
5. **Custom**: Also known as advanced mode, this option lets you create a decision tree and develop complex flows. You can add any action or API request at any point during the conversation. The agent will know what to do and when to do it, from start to finish, including what to say and under which conditions.

#### Step 2: Agent Customization

1. **Agent Names, Languages & Voices**:

		style={{ 
		borderRadius: '18px', 
		}}
	/>
	<img
		className="hidden dark:block"
		src="/images/exemples/nameLang.png"
		alt="API Call Setup"
		style={{ 
		borderRadius: '18px', 
		}}
	/>
   - **Add Multilingual Agents**: If you want your Pearl to speak more than one language, click on the **"+"** button to add additional agent configurations.
	If during the conversation the caller requests to switch to another language, and you've added that language to your agent configurations, Pearl will smoothly inform the caller that they will be transferred to a representative who speaks that language. 
	The conversation will then continue with the agent configured for the requested language.
	Assign a name to each agent configuration. This name will be used during phone conversations in the corresponding language.
	Explore  [Voice and Language](/pages/languages) to view all the language options available.



   - **Default Agent Configuration**: The first agent configuration you add is set as the default. This agent will initiate the conversation when a call begins.

3. **Personality**: Set the personality traits of the agent to match the desired interaction style.
4. **Timezone**: Define the timezone of the agent. This influences time-related actions, such as booking meetings.

#### Step 3: Agent Knowledge Base

1. **Company Name**: Enter the name of the company the agent represents during conversations.
2. **Company Description**: Provide a brief description of the company, including sector and basic information.
3. **Pearl Knowledge Base**: Provide detailed information about your services, pricing, location, operational data, and website. This can be entered as free text or by uploading a file.

#### Step 4: Flow Configuration

1. **Opening Sentence**: Define the first sentence Pearl will say when answering the phone. You can include variables like "company name" or "agent name." Avoid using lead-specific variables for inbound calls.
2. **Flow Script**: For use cases other than Personal Secretary, provide the script that Pearl will follow during conversations, similar to a script given to a human salesperson. It's very important to understand how to use [Variables](/pages/variables) to enhance the conversation experience and give Pearl better capabilities to handle the interaction.
3. **Call Actions**: Specify actions that Pearl can perform during the call, such as booking meetings, transferring calls, or sending emails and SMS messages.

For more details on actions, refer to the [Actions](/pages/action) page.

#### Step 5: Pearl Name

1. **Name of the Pearl**: Assign a friendly name to your Pearl for easy retrieval.
2. **Choose Your Pearl**: Select a logo for your Pearl from a list of available options.
3. **Define the Success of Your Pearl**: Specify what constitutes a successful call for your Pearl, such as booking a meeting, obtaining client interest, or qualifying a lead.\n\n
This defined success will be reflected in the status of your leads list when you launch a campaign,  allowing you to effectively sort and manage your leads.
4. **Indicator Tags**:

	className="block dark:hidden"
	src="/images/exemples/indicatorTags.png"
	alt="API Call Setup"
	style={{ 
	borderRadius: '18px', 
	}}
	/>
	<img
		className="hidden dark:block"
		src="/images/exemples/indicatorTags.png"
		alt="API Call Setup"
		style={{ 
		borderRadius: '18px', 
		}}
	/>
   - **Purpose of Indicator Tags**: Indicator tags allow you to label your conversations based on specific criteria or events that occur during the interaction. This helps in categorizing and analyzing conversations later.

   - **How to Add Indicator Tags**:
     - **Add a Tag**: Click on the option to add a new indicator tag.
     - **Color**: Choose a color for the tag to make it easily identifiable.
     - **Name**: Provide a name for the tag.
     - **Description (When to Assign)**: Describe the condition or event when the tag should be assigned during the conversation.

   - **Example Use Case**:
     - If you're conducting a poll to find out what people prefer to drink in the morning:
       - **Tag "Coffee"**:
         - **Color**: Brown
         - **Name**: Coffee
         - **When to Assign**: "If the prospect prefers to drink coffee in the morning."
       - **Tag "Tea"**:
         - **Color**: Green
         - **Name**: Tea
         - **When to Assign**: "If the prospect prefers to drink tea in the morning."
     - During the conversation, if the prospect expresses a preference for coffee or tea, the corresponding tag will be assigned, allowing you to easily filter and analyze these interactions later.

## Best Practices for Pearl Creation

When creating your Pearl, consider the following best practices to ensure optimal performance and customer satisfaction:

- **Use Variables Wisely**: Add the first name and last name variables into the opening sentence only for outbound calls when you are sure that the lead list contains this information.
- **Cultural Alignment**: Ensure the chosen language and conversational style align with the cultural expectations of your audience.
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Continuously refine your Pearl based on feedback and interaction outcomes to improve conversational effectiveness.

## Summary

Creating a Pearl is integral to deploying effective AI-driven interactions in NLPearl.AI. By carefully configuring each component of your Pearl, you ensure that your AI agents deliver not only consistent and personalized customer service but also drive meaningful engagements that can enhance overall business performance.
