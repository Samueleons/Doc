## Managing Agents

In NLPearl.AI, agents are crucial to handling your inbound and outbound call activities. The number of agents you have determines the number of simultaneous calls your system can handle, whether it’s for inbound queries or outbound campaigns.


### Understanding Agents

Agents in NLPearl.AI are virtual entities that represent the capacity to handle calls. Each agent can manage one call at a time, and you can allocate multiple agents to any activity to handle concurrent calls.

### Setting Up Agents for Your Activities

1. **Purchase Agents**: Acquire agents from the platform to increase your call handling capacity. The number of agents you need will depend on your specific use case and expected call volume.
2. **Allocate Agents to Activities**: Assign the purchased agents to your inbound or outbound activities. For example, if you assign two agents to a campaign, it can simultaneously call two leads at a time.
3. **Adjust Agent Numbers**: You can increase or decrease the number of agents allocated to any activity based on your needs. This flexibility helps optimize your resources and manage costs effectively.

### Subscription and Agent Purchase

Depending on your subscription plan, a specific number of agents are provided for free. If your needs exceed this allocation, you can purchase additional agents directly from the platform.

- **Subscription Plans**: Each subscription plan offers a base number of agents included at no additional cost. Higher-tier plans offer more agents.
- **Purchasing Additional Agents**: If you need more agents, you can purchase them on a monthly basis. Each agent purchase is valid for at least one month and can be renewed as needed.
- **Agent Deletion**: You can delete agents if they are no longer needed. Deleted agents will be removed from your account at the end of their billing cycle, ensuring you only pay for what you use.

### Managing Agents on the Platform
