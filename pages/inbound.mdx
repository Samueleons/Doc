## Setting Up Inbound Activities

Once you have created a Pearl in NLPearl.AI, you can utilize it to set up Inbound Activities. This feature enables your Pearl to receive inbound calls, providing a dynamic and responsive customer service experience.


### What are Inbound Activities?

Inbound Activities refer to the capability of your conversational AI to handle incoming calls. This feature allows you to engage with callers immediately and effectively, using the conversational flows defined in your Pearl.

### Steps to Create an Inbound Activity

1. **Purchase a Phone Number**: You first need to acquire a phone number from our platform. This number will be dedicated to your Inbound Activity and can receive calls from anywhere at any time.

2. **Assign the Phone Number to Your Pearl**: Link the purchased phone number to the Pearl you want to use for handling inbound calls. This connects your conversational flow to real-world interactions.

3. **Configure Inbound Settings**: Set up your inbound call parameters, such as:
   - **Number of Agents**: Specify the number of agents that will handle calls simultaneously.
   - **Waiting Queue Message**: Define the sentence that will be said to callers if they enter the waiting queue.
   - **Queue Music**: Choose the song that will be played while callers wait in the queue.

### Managing Call Volume with Queues

If your Inbound Activity experiences high call volumes, callers will not be turned away. Instead, they will enter a waiting queue where they can listen to customizable messages and music until an AI agent becomes available.

### Monitoring and Adjusting Your Inbound Activities

While basic monitoring of call logs and activity reports can be done via our API, any modifications to the activity setup or features like voice changes and language settings need to be handled directly on the platform.
