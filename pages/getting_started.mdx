## Getting Started with NLPearl.AI

Welcome to NLPearl.AI! We're excited to have you onboard. This guide will walk you through the steps from registration to utilizing the full potential of our platform, including creating Pearls, managing activities, and understanding our billing system.

### Registration and Initial Setup

When you first register on our platform, we offer a few complimentary minutes and the ability to create Pearls to test a few calls. This allows you to get a feel for our system without any initial commitment.

### Trial Phase

During the trial phase, you can:

- **Create Pearls**: Set up your conversational flows and test a few calls to understand how our AI agents operate.
- **Complimentary Minutes**: Utilize the free minutes provided to make initial test calls.

However, note that at this stage, access to full inbound and outbound activities is restricted. To unlock the complete range of features, you need to subscribe to a plan.

### Subscribing to a Plan

Once you subscribe to a plan, you unlock the full potential of the NLPearl.AI platform. Here's what you get:

- **Full Access to Activities**: Engage in both inbound and outbound activities with no restrictions.
- **Free Agents**: Receive a number of free concurrent agents based on your subscription plan, which will be automatically available for your activities.
- **Free US Phone Numbers**: Depending on your plan, you will also receive free US phone numbers.
- **Additional Free Minutes**: Your subscription plan includes additional free minutes to use for calls.

### Using Your Minutes and Credits

All calls you make will deduct from your available free minutes. Once the free minutes are exhausted, you will need to use credits to continue making calls. 

#### Auto-Recharge Feature

To ensure uninterrupted activities, we recommend activating the auto-recharge feature. This automatically recharges your account to a target balance when it falls below a defined threshold, ensuring your operations never stop due to insufficient funds.

### Pricing and Credits

The price for additional minutes varies based on your subscription plan. Credits can also be used to purchase additional agents or phone numbers if you have sufficient balance.

### Managing Your Credits

Once you exhaust your credits, your account will go through two stages:

1. **Limited Activities**: When your credits are below zero, your activities will continue, but the number of concurrent agents per activity will be reduced to one.
2. **Blocked Activities**: If your account reaches a debt of 10% of your monthly subscription price, all activities will be suspended until you recharge your credits.
