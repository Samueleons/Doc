### Payment and Billing

Phone numbers are billed on a monthly basis. There are two types of payment methods:

- **Using Credits**:
  - If you have enough credits in your NLPearl.AI account, the phone numbers will be purchased using these credits.
  - The cost will be deducted from your available credit balance.

- **Using Credit Card**:
  - If you do not have sufficient credits, the phone numbers will be purchased using the credit card associated with your account.
  - You will receive an invoice for the transaction.

- **Subscription Inclusions**:
  - If your subscription plan includes phone numbers and you have not yet used your included allowance, the purchase will be free for the number of phone numbers included in your plan.

### Managing Your Phone Numbers

After purchasing, you can manage your phone numbers directly from the platform:

- **Assign to Campaigns**: Allocate phone numbers to your inbound or outbound campaigns as needed.

### Deleting Phone Numbers

If you no longer need a phone number, you can schedule it for deletion:

1. **Access Phone Numbers Tab**:
   - Go to the **Phone Numbers** section in your Settings.

2. **Select Phone Number to Delete**:
   - Choose the phone number you wish to delete.

3. **Schedule Deletion**:
   - Confirm that you want to delete the phone number.
   - The phone number will remain active until its purchase anniversary date, after which it will be removed from your account.

**Note**: Deletion of phone numbers occurs on the anniversary day of the purchase. This means you can continue to use the phone number until that date.

### Important Considerations

- **Monthly Billing Cycle**: Phone numbers are billed on a monthly cycle starting from the date of purchase.
- **Country Code Limitations**: Currently, only US phone numbers are available for direct purchase. For other countries, consider alternative integration options.
- **Payment Methods**: Ensure your account has sufficient credits or a valid credit card on file to avoid interruptions in service.
