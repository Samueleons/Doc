## Setting Up Outbound Campaigns

NLPearl.AI provides robust features to manage outbound campaigns efficiently. Using the Pearl flows you have created, you can set up outbound calls to engage with your leads according to a predefined schedule.



### What are Outbound ?

Outbound Campaigns enable your AI agents to make outgoing calls to a list of leads. These calls follow the conversational logic defined in your Pearl, ensuring consistent and effective communication with your potential clients.

### Steps to Create an Outbound Campaign

1. **Create a Pearl**: Ensure you have created a Pearl that defines the flow of the conversation for your outbound calls.

2. **Add Leads**: Add the leads you want to contact directly from the platform. You can input lead details such as name, phone number, and any other relevant information.

3. **Schedule Calls**: Define the schedule for when the AI agents will make the outbound calls. You can specify dates, times, and frequency to suit your campaign needs.

3. **Configure Outbound Settings**: Set up your outbound parameters, such as:
   - **Number of Agents**: Specify the number of agents that will handle calls simultaneously.
   - **Default TimeZone**: The default timezone will be the timezone of all the leads you enter if you don't specify their timezone.
   - **Affect a Phone Number**: Outbound activities do not require you to assign a specific phone number, but it can be done. If you do not assign a phone number, the default NLPearl phone number will be used for calls.

### Managing Your Outbound Campaigns

Once your campaign is set up, NLPearl.AI handles the outbound calls autonomously, following the Pearl flow you created. The platform allows you to monitor the progress and performance of your campaigns in real-time.
