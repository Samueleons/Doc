## API-Driven Outbound Activities

NLPearl.AI's API provides a powerful interface for developers to create and manage outbound call activities directly through code, offering complete control over the implementation and execution of these interactions.

### Overview of API-Driven Outbound Activities

Unlike platform-managed campaigns, API-driven activities allow for direct integration into your existing systems and workflows. This setup enables a more dynamic application of outbound call logic tailored to specific business needs, where calls can be triggered based on custom criteria defined within your application.

### Setting Up API Outbound Activities

1. **Obtain an API Key**: Secure an API key from NLPearl.AI to authenticate and interact with our outbound call API.

2. **Create or Manage Outbound Activities**: Use the API to define and initiate a new outbound activity or manage an existing one created on the platform. Set parameters such as call logic, timing, and handling instructions programmatically.

3. **Manage Leads Programmatically**: Integrate your existing lead management systems directly with the outbound activity. There is no need to upload leads to the platform; instead, use your databases to manage and utilize leads dynamically.

### Configuring Your Outbound Calls

Configure your outbound calls with extensive customization options available through the API:

- **Define Call Logic**: Specify the conditions under which calls should be initiated, paused, or terminated based on real-time data.
- **Schedule and Trigger Calls**: Schedule calls or trigger them instantly based on application logic or customer interactions.

### Handling Platform-Managed Campaigns

If you decide to make calls via a campaign that is running from the platform, you will still need to handle the number of simultaneous agents. The API allows you to control and monitor these aspects to ensure efficient call management.

### API Endpoints for Outbound Calls

Detailed documentation of API endpoints includes:

- **POST `/outbound/create`**: Endpoint to create a new outbound activity.
- **PUT `/outbound/update`**: Endpoint to update existing outbound settings.
- **DELETE `/outbound/{id}`**: Endpoint to delete an outbound activity.
